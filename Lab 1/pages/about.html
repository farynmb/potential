  <h1>About</h1>
  
  <p>Photography has always been a means of relaxation and merely a hobby. 
      I learned from my father, who learned from his father who read a book about picture taking.
      As time goes on I am begining to realize how it captures
      the beauty in the small moments that make up eternity.
